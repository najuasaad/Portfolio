This project was definitely a challenge for me. Structure wise, I used a few flex boxes. The different sections are all in a flex box and the first section has a flex box in itself. The overall structure scales down with resize to phone screen sizes. The mobile version I wanted to seem like it was flowing from the left a little more since the screen is positioned in the opposite direction. 

The styling is easy to read and simple. The links in the nav will change color with hover over, but the links in the bottom are obviously links, so I chose to leave those alone. I styled a div to create a graphic looking header border. I did a contrasted text on backgrounds with easy to distinguish colored sections.
